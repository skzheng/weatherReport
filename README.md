## Getting started
### System requirements
- Ensure you have Node.js installed (preferably version 8.1.x)
- Make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed.

### Development
1. Install the project's dependencies using `yarn`.
1. Serve the project locally using `yarn run dev`. By default, it will run on port 3000. You can customize which port it runs on by doing `yarn run dev -p XXXX`.
1. Be sure to make proper use of version control by regularly committing your work.

### Technology overview
This project is using [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), which enables server-side rendered React. In addition to server-side rendering (which is [very useful](https://medium.com/@adamzerner/client-side-rendering-vs-server-side-rendering-a32d2cf3bfcc) with regard to performance and SEO), it has a lot of built-in features such as automatic code splitting, static HTML export (what we use for our marketing website), hot module replacement, simple client-side routing.
